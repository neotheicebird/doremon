Doremon -- Whatsapp listener bot
================================

A simple bot which uses Yowsup to connect to whatsapp groups, read
conversations and right now it can search for messages which have a #<tag> in it.

Features:
=========

    - Joins whatsapp group
    - Retreives all #ed conversations and the corresponding tags
    - Stores the content as a JSON object

Yet to be done:
===============

    - Updates a webpage with the content extracted (preferably using django)

Future features:
=========================

    - perform operations based on commands issued by users through messages.
    - one of the operations is to communicate with google drive api and edit
      documents

Feel free to suggest any feature the bot should have.
